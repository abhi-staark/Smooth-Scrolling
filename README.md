# ðŸ“Œ Flutter Scroll to Section Demo  

A Flutter project that demonstrates how to **smoothly scroll to a specific section** of a long screen.  
This pattern is especially useful for content-heavy apps (insights, FAQs, documentation, e-learning, etc.), where users can jump directly to the information they need.

## âœ¨ Features  

- ðŸ”‘ **Highlight Navigation** â€“ Tap a topic on Screen 1, auto-scroll to the relevant section on Screen 2.  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Smooth Scroll Animation** â€“ Uses `Scrollable.ensureVisible` for a clean user experience.  
- ðŸ§© **Dynamic Section Keys** â€“ Each section is mapped to a `GlobalKey` for precise control.  
- ðŸ“± **Clean UI Demo** â€“ Example data is filled with Gen-Z inspired sample content (easy to replace with real content).
